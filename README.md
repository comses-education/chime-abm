# chime-abm

The CHIME ABM was designed to investigate the dynamics of hazardous weather communication and decision making, in the context of evolving hazard forecasts and the complex modern information environment. It is implemented in Netlogo, version 6. 

The model can be run by opening the Chime.nlogo file with the Netlogo program. Geographic and forecast information used by the model are included in the Storms and Region folders.

Detailed information concerning the coding of the model can be found in the CHIME ABM ODD document which follows the Object, Design Concepts and Details format as described by Grimm et. al (2006). 


Detailed information about how to use this model and test if it is working correctly can be found in the document entitled HowToUse.md
