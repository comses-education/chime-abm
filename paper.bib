	abstract = {This article introduces an agent-based modeling laboratory for investigating how evolving hazard information, propagated through forecaster, media, public official, and peer information networks, affects patterns of public protective-action decisions during hurricane threats. The model, called {CHIME} {ABM}, provides a platform for integrating atmospheric science, social science, and computer and information science knowledge and data to explore the complex socio-ecological dynamics of modern hazard information and decision systems from a new perspective. First, the model's interdisciplinary conceptualization and implementation is described. Results are then presented from experiments demonstrating the model's behaviors and comparing patterns of evacuation decisions when key agent parameters and the geographical population distribution, forecast skill, and storm are varied. The article illustrates how this type of theoretically and empirically informed digital laboratory can be used to develop new insights into the interactions among environmental hazards, information flow, protective decisions, and societal outcomes.},

At the same time, technological advances, such as the Internet, mobile devices, and social media, are transforming how people exchange and interact with information. In this modern information environment, risk communication, interpretation, and decision-making are rapidly evolving processes that intersect across space, time, and society. Instead of a linear or iterative process in which individual members of the public assess and respond to distinct pieces of weather forecast or warning information, this article conceives of weather prediction, communication, and decision-making as an interconnected dynamic system. In this expanded framework, information and uncertainty evolve in conjunction with people’s risk perceptions, vulnerabilities, and decisions as a hazardous weather threat approaches; these processes are intertwined with evolving social interactions in the physical and digital worlds. Along with the framework, the article presents two interdisciplinary research approaches for advancing the understanding of this complex system and the processes within it: analysis of social media streams and computational natural–human system modeling. Examples from ongoing research are used to demonstrate these approaches and illustrate the types of new insights they can reveal. This expanded perspective together with research approaches, such as those introduced, can help researchers and practitioners understand and improve the creation and communication of information in atmospheric science and other fields.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},
