# Summary

The flow of information during a hazardous weather event plays a critical role in the risk assesment of people endangered by the weather event. When such a weather event occurs, multiple actors such as forecasters, television and radio broadcastors, social media and personal connections make up interconnected components of a dynamic coupled human-natural system that transmits information. The complex and continually changing nature of hazardous weather forecasts can result in underestimates of risk, overestimates of risk or confusion leading to delayed protective actions `[@Morss et al., :2017; @Watts et al., :2019]`. In order to effectively advise citizens, models which integrate empirical and social and information research, as well as geophysical science must be used to enable controlled experiments of hazardous weather scenarios.

- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
